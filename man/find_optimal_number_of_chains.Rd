\title{Choose the number of chains baed on how many draws we need from the posterior distribution
Because there is a fix cost (warmup) to starting a new chain,
we need to use the minimum amount that we can parallelise}
\usage{
find_optimal_number_of_chains(how_many_posterior_draws,
  max_number_to_check = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{how_many_posterior_draws}{A real number of posterior draws needed}

\item{max_number_to_check}{A sane upper plateau}
}
\value{
A Stan fit object
}
